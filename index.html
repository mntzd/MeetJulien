        <h2>Hi I'm Julien and I love creating products with impact</h2>

        <div class="wrapper">
        <div id="copytext">
          <h3>Why do I want to code?</h3>
        <p>During my studies of psychology I was contemplating how could I combine my interest and academic background revolving around the human psyche with my passion and fascination for technology?
          <br>
          During the early 2010's, I was lucky enough to be an intern for a professor of "Human Computer Interaction" (HCI) and "Mobile Information Systems". The internship was tough and I fucked up on multiple occasions, but it helped me grow my interest and knowledge into the [for psychologists] niche direction of Usability and User Experience Design.
          <br>
          Digging deeper and deeper into the field of HCI & UX, I began to plan my thesis around a data-driven behaviour analysis of car-drivers and ended up partnering with TomTom to optimize specific issues in their product. 
          The navigation system's algorithm produced an usability issue in certain situations, so I analyzed human problem solving strategies in similar situations and re-applied them on the algorithm.
          </p>
          <p>
          7 years ago I started working as a junior UX Designer in one of Berlins Product Agencies. The demand was there, not only for UX but also for Product Owners (POs), so the next logical thing after working for a few months as UX-Designer was to additionally get certified as PO.
          <br>
          During the first 2 years in the agency my learning curve skyrocketed (and I loved it) but unfortunately we grew too big too fast and our biggest client pulled out. So the agency closed its doors for good. This was when a former colleague, who was building a design & prodcut consulting team for a large international technology consultancy, offered me to check out the consulting world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shift from product to business, agency to consulting, was tougher than expected, but I eventually adapted. More Workshops and conceptualizations, a large variety of clients and the opportunity to closely interact with our own startup-hub made this a very interesting experience with lots of personal growth and prosperous personal connections.
          After 2 years though, time was ripe for something new. One of the Big-4 consultancies planned to build a design capability (and Team) in Germany, so I joined as their Lead-UX-Designer. <br>
          The culture was something I have never really been able to adapt to, even after 4 years of working there, but the market access was just something else. Me and another Senior Designer hired more designers and had plenty of interesting projects with a lot of different clients. While we may have had success from a business perspective, the rate of new learnings decreased by the day, since the only thing you will get measured in is money earned. Especially in the large software projects I felt like just being a designer is not sufficient. I wanted to close the gap, to build the bridge between concept and creation. But my job did not allow for that, so I pulled the brakes and will re-focus on what is important to me: exploring new things in life, finding joy through learning and growing.
        </p>

        
          <p>My personal goal is to evolve towards being a <b>"Full Stack Product
        Person"</b> - meaning I can not only make informed decisions in the
        different dimensions of the product creation process, but be an active
        and defining part.</p>

              <h3>Understanding the 3 dimensions of a successful product</h3>
              <p id="aria3dimensions">
                Desirability refers to the product's ability to fulfill the
                customers' needs and wants. A desirable product addresses the
                customers' pain points, offers unique value propositions, and has a
                market demand. Feasibility focuses on the product's technical
                viability, resource availability, and time constraints. A feasible
                product can be developed within the given budget, time frame, and
                technical specifications. Viability considers the product's
                financial viability, profitability, and sustainability. A viable
                product generates enough revenue to cover the development cost,
                generate profits, and maintain market relevance over the long term.
                All three dimensions are crucial for successful product development,
                and neglecting any of them could lead to product failure. Therefore,
                a balance between desirability, feasibility, and viability is
                necessary to create a successful product.

                  Define user personas: Based on your user research, define user
                  personas that represent your target audience. User personas are
                  fictional characters that embody your users' characteristics,
                  needs, and goals. They help to guide product development decisions
                  and keep the team focused on the user's needs.

                  touchpoints with your product or service. Identify pain points and
                  opportunities to improve the user experience.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Conduct usability testing: Use usability testing to gather
                  feedback on your product or service. This can include A/B testing,
                  focus groups, and user testing sessions. Test early and often to
                  ensure that your product is meeting the needs of your users.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Use agile development methodologies: Use agile development
                  methodologies to iterate and improve your product based on user
                  feedback. Continuously gather feedback and make adjustments to the
                  product roadmap accordingly.

              <h3>Concept 2 Reality: The Iterative Approach</h3>
              <p id="ariascrum">
                Agility plays a significant role in successful product development
                because it allows the development team to quickly respond to changes
                and adapt to new circumstances. In an agile product development
                approach, the focus is on delivering a minimum viable product (MVP)
                that meets the customers' most critical needs in the shortest
                possible time frame. The MVP is then iteratively improved through
                feedback and testing. Agility supports desirability by ensuring that
                the product meets the customers' needs and wants. By continually
                gathering feedback and adapting the product accordingly, the
                development team can ensure that the product remains relevant to the
                market and satisfies the customers' evolving needs. Agility supports
                feasibility by allowing the team to quickly identify and address
                technical challenges and resource constraints. By breaking down the
                product development process into smaller, manageable tasks, the team
                can focus on resolving one issue at a time and make adjustments to
                the development plan as needed. Agility supports viability by
                helping the team to make informed decisions based on market trends
                and feedback. By constantly testing and iterating the product, the
                team can quickly identify which features are generating revenue and
                which are not, and adjust the product roadmap accordingly. In
                summary, agility is crucial in successful product development
                because it helps the team to quickly respond to changes, adapt to
                new circumstances, and ensure that the product remains desirable,
                feasible, and viable over time.
