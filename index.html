          <h2>Why do I want to learn coding?</h2>
          <p>Get to know more about me & my motivation.</p>

          <p>
            During my studies of psychology I was contemplating how could I
            combine my interest and academic background revolving around the
            human psyche with my passion and fascination for technology? I tried
            to learn basic technical concepts by myself, but programming is hard
            and my studies kept my busy, so I was not able to achieve a level
            that would allow me to create value for other through technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the early 2010's, I was lucky enough to be an intern for a
            professor of "Human Computer Interaction" (HCI) and "Mobile
            Information Systems". The internship was tough and I fucked up on
            multiple occasions, but it helped me grow my interest and knowledge
            into the [for psychologists] niche direction of Usability and User
            Experience Design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Digging deeper and deeper into the field of HCI & UX, I began to
            plan my thesis around a data-driven behaviour analysis of
            car-drivers and ended up partnering with TomTom to optimize specific
            issues in their product. The navigation system's algorithm produced
            an usability issue in certain situations, so I analyzed human
            problem solving strategies in similar situations and re-applied them
            on the system & algorithm. Up to this point all my work was
            conceptual, since I still did not know how to properly apply
            programming and technical analysis to solve complex problems. I felt
            like there was a blind-spot to my results, and I was reliant on
            other people to make sure the conceptualizations were also fit for
            realization.
          </p>
          <p>
            7 years ago I started working as a junior UX Designer in one of
            Berlins Product Agencies. The demand was there, not only for UX but
            also for Product Owners (POs), so the next logical thing after
            working for a few months as UX-Designer was to additionally get
            certified as PO. As part of a Development Team we developed multiple
            cool things, and I was constantly amazed by the things our
            code-magicians could do to create some ~real~ value for customers &
            users.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the first 2 years in the agency my learning curve skyrocketed
            (and I loved it) but unfortunately we grew too big too fast and our
            biggest client pulled out. So the agency closed its doors for good.
            This was when a former colleague, who was building a design &
            prodcut consulting team for a large international technology
            consultancy, offered me to check out the consulting world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shift from product to business, agency to consulting, was
            tougher than expected, but I eventually adapted. More Workshops and
            even more concept-work, a large variety of clients and the
            opportunity to closely interact with our own startup-hub made this a
            very interesting experience with lots of personal growth and
            prosperous personal connections. After 2 years though, time was ripe
            for something new. One of the Big-4 consultancies planned to build a
            design capability (and Team) in Germany, so I joined as their
            Lead-UX-Designer. With the projects and programs in the consultancy
            I was exposed to large tech-projects and could apply my basic
            techn-skills to build prototypes (along the other conceptual and UX
            work), but I never even touched the quality then for production
            level code or features. I wanted to further grow into this
            direction, but being very busy with projects, managing a team and
            the overall culture made that close to impossible.<br />
            While we may have had success from a business perspective, the rate
            of new learnings decreased by the day, since the only thing you will
            get measured in is money earned. Especially in the large software
            projects I felt like "just" being a designer is not sufficient. I
            wanted to close the gap, to build the bridge between concept and
            creation. But my job did not allow for that, so I pulled the brakes.
            I am grateful for the opportunities to grow and will re-focus on
            what is important to me: exploring new things in life, finding joy
            through learning and evolving.
          </p>
          <p>
            My personal goal is to evolve towards being a
            <strong>"Full Stack Product Person"</strong> - meaning I can not
            only make informed decisions in the different dimensions of the
            product creation process, but be an active and defining part.
